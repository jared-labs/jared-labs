**What is this?**

I’m Jared, and this repo is my living lab notebook + portfolio. It documents how I run my homelab proxmox cluster, and it also captures adjacent personal projects. Expect a mix of runbooks I actually use, architecture/decisions, inventories, and the occasional one-off build (not everything here is pure IT/SysAdmin/SecOps).

**What you’ll find**
- **Runbooks:** spinning up vm's/service, adding a proxmox node, rolling upgrades, backup/restore tests, etc.
- **Docs:** topology, decisions, inventories, storage/backups, gotchas.
- **Troubleshooting:** real-world quirks and fixes I’ve hit.
- **One-offs:** small side projects (Home Assistant, automations, 3D/DIY).

**What this is not**
- A step-by-step vendor tutorial.

**Who it’s for**
- Me (first) — operational notes I can repeat.  
- You (if helpful) — see how I work or borrow what works.

**Repo layout**
- `README.md` — high-level overview and current state (this page)  
- `docs/homelab/runbooks/` — task-oriented runbooks (coming online)  
- `assets/` — screenshots/diagrams
