# Homelab & Projects

> **What is this?**  
> My living lab notebook + portfolio. It documents how I run my homelab Proxmox cluster and adjacent personal projects. Expect a mix of **runbooks I actually use**, architecture/decisions, inventories, and the occasional one-off build. Not everything here is pure IT/SysAdmin/SecOps.

## What you’ll find
- **Runbooks:** spinning up VMs/services, adding a Proxmox node, rolling upgrades, backup/restore tests.
- **Docs:** topology, decisions, inventories, storage/backups, gotchas.
- **Troubleshooting:** real-world quirks and fixes I’ve hit.
- **One-offs:** Home Assistant automations, 3D/DIY, etc.

## What this is not
- A step-by-step vendor tutorial.
- A place for secrets (keys/creds are redacted or omitted).

## Who it’s for
- **Me** — operational notes I can repeat.
- **You** — see how I work or borrow what helps.

## Repo layout
- `README.md` — high-level overview and current state (this page)  
- `docs/homelab/runbooks/` — task-oriented runbooks (coming online)  
- `assets/` — screenshots/diagrams

_This is a living document; sections reflect current reality and evolve over time._
